# platformer
dino platformer game  
Made with Phaser and PostgreSQL for high scores.  
I made this to stop my son from turning off the WiFi.  
Try to collect as many mushrooms as you can without falling or being pushed off the screen  
The orange mushrooms are special power ups. Double jump, Glide jump, or Fly.
